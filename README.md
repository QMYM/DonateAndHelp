# DonateAndHelp

- Project title:

 Our project name is "DonateAndHelp" which is a platform on a website and mobile application that connects beneficiaries with donors in order to receive money donations from donors in response to the campaigns uploaded by beneficiaries on the platform. In addition, donors can create campaigns for items they want to donate for beneficiaries.

- Motivation:

 In Jordan, there are no online platforms to connect beneficiaries with donors, so "DonateAndHelp" can solve this issue and build bridges between beneficiaries and donors, where beneficiaries can recieve money donations online as well as donors can upload their items for donations.

- Tech/framework used:

 We used React Native and React JS for mobile and web developemnt respectively, while for backend developemnt, we used Node.js Express Framework and MongoDB.

- Features:

 1- The user whether beneficiary or donor can sign up and login into the platform.
 2- The donor can create campaigns for items to donate. Similarly, benefeciary can create campaigns for money donations.
 3- The donor can search for beneficiaries to donate. Likewise, benfeficary can search for donors.
 4- Beneficiaries and donors can send messages to each others.
 5- The user whether beneficiary or donor can edit and view their profile information in the profile page.
 6- The user whether beneficiary or donor can upload and change the profile and background images in the profile page.
